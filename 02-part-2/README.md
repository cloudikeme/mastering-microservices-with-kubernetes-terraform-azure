# Mastering Microservices PART 2: Creating a GitHub Repository from the Linux Terminal

This repository accompanies **Part 2** of the **Mastering Microservices** blog series. In this part, we'll guide you through setting up version control for your microservices project directly from your Linux terminal using Git and GitHub CLI.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- **Create a GitHub repository using the `gh` CLI.**
- **Initialize a local Git repository.**
- **Structure a microservices project effectively.**
- **Push your initial codebase to GitHub.**
- **Create a `.gitignore` file to manage ignored files.**
- **Write a clear and informative `README.md` file.**

## Project Structure

The project structure outlined in this part of the series is designed for a microservices-based conference application. Here's a breakdown:

```
conference-microservices-app/
│
├── devbox/                 # Devbox environment configuration
│   ├── devbox.json         # Devbox config for tools like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
│   └── ...
│
├── services/               # Microservices code
│   ├── frontend/           # Frontend service (React, Angular, etc.)
│   ├── c4p-service/        # Call for Papers service (Node.js/Go)
│   ├── agenda-service/     # Agenda management service (Node.js/Go)
│   └── notifications-service/ # Notifications service (Go, Kafka-based)
│
├── infrastructure/         # Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files
│   ├── kubernetes/         # Kubernetes manifests for deploying services
│   ├── terraform/          # Terraform files for cloud infrastructure
│   └── ...
│
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files
├── README.md               # Project overview and documentation
└── docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose file for running microservices locally
```

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Blog Post:** Head over to the [Mastering Microservices PART 2: Creating a Github Repository from the Terminal Using Git and GitHub CLI](<Blog Post Link Here>) blog post for a detailed walkthrough.

2. **Clone the Repository (Optional):**  You can clone this repository if you want to follow along with the code examples:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/conference-microservices-app.git
   ```

3. **Continue the Series:** Check out the next parts of the **Mastering Microservices** series to build upon this foundation and dive into developing the individual microservices.
