# Mastering Microservices From Development to Deployment with Kubernetes, Terraform, and Azure

Welcome to **Mastering Microservices**, a hands-on tutorial series that guides you through the entire process of building, deploying, and managing a microservices-based application.  

**ðŸš€ Follow along with the tutorials on my blog:** [https://cloudikeme.com/mastering-microservices-from-development-to-deployment](https://cloudikeme.com/mastering-microservices-from-development-to-deployment)

## Project Overview

This repository provides the code for the "Mastering Microservices" series. We'll create a **conference application** using modern cloud-native technologies.

**Key Features:**

* **Call for Papers (CFP)**
* **Agenda Management**
* **Real-time Notifications**
* **User Management**

**Tech Stack:**

* **Go (Golang)**: For building the microservices.
* **Docker:** For containerizing the services.
* **Kubernetes:** For orchestrating and managing the application.
* **Terraform:** For provisioning infrastructure on Azure.
* **Azure:** Our cloud platform of choice.
* **GitHub Actions:** For automated CI/CD.
